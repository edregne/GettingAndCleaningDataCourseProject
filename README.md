## Summarized Activity Metrics from Captured Smartphone Data
### Eric Dregne
These are summary tables of the data for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones experiments. The data prepared was originally collected from the embedded accelerometer of the Samsung smartphones worn on the waist of 30 test subjects. Measures were collected over six activities, (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING).

Mean and standard deviation data has been extracted and labeled in the first text file (activities_mean_std.txt) and the resulting summary of the average value by activity and subject of the collected metrics (tidy_activity_means.txt).
Included is the R script for generating the values.

Files included:
-	README.md
-	CodeBook.md
-	run_analysis.R
-	activities_mean_std.txt
-	tidy_activity_means.txt
